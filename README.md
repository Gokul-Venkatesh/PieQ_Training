### OOP
In procedural programming (like C) we could able to bundle only data using "structures" and functions were always written seperately.
* To overcome this they introduced oop which bundles data and behaviour together using "classes".
* Also they enchances security through encapsulation , by controlling how the data can be accessed.
* They provide modular and reusable code which is easy to maintain 


## Class
A class in simple terms is a blueprint or template that consists of data (variable / properties ) and behaviour (function / methods)
It's basically a code definition of structure describing what an object will have and how it will behave
Eg: A house plan may consist of features like rooms, paint color, and modern design — but it’s not the actual house.
The actual house can be built from this plan, and each house created from it is an object with those features.


## Objects
Objects are instance of classes
above we have a house plan so from that we can create multiple instances as house1 , house 2 etc... and have different propeties to each house using the same class.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a single unit i.e the class  and restricting direct access to some components of the object.
eg.access specifiers such as private protected and public.
Improves security .


## Abstraction
Abstraction means hiding internal implementation details and showing only the essential features to the outside world. 
can be achieved with the help of abstract class and interface 

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where  class (child) can reuse the properties and methods of another class (parent).
used to avoid code duplication and ensure reusability

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one function or object behaves differently based on context.
It's of two types:
*compile time (function overloading)
*Runtime (function overriding)
